 * interact with it in any way you feel is appropriate.
 * <p/>
 * We accept absolutely no liability and offer no warranty; the API is provided on an as-is basis. We won't and can't
 * be held liable if the API doesn't work properly or breaks things. We also reserve the right to change the API as
 * needed, and we do not guarantee our changes will be back-ported or backward compatible.

 * Please do not package the API in binary form with your distributions. If the API is changed - which may occur at
 * any time - your binary distribution of the API can and most likely will conflict with those distributed internally
 * by MoarPeripherals.
 * <p/>
 * If you think we have made an error or you would like (limited) advice on how to implement the API, you can contact
 * us on the ComputerCraft Forums, Twitter, GitHub, email, or IRC. Good luck!
